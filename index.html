                            <p>I was brought into UltraServe to set up a framework for a new Research and Development project that allows people to manage their entire cloud infrastucture both easily and effectively. My role here requires me to be adroit in many different technologies so that the well written, polyglot codebase will function well now and into the future.</p>
                            <p>The goal was to modularise each aspect, use the right tool for the right job and maintain over 60% code coverage all while keeping technical debt to a minimum. Currently, we have almost 80% code coverage and utilise several different types of technologies. Each part of the application is functionally modularised into separate components and there is almost zero technical debt.</p>

In that time, I had the opportunity to work on many small projects as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia's Banknotes website which included three JavaScript games:</p>

                            <p>At Viocorp, I led a team in extending a proprietary CMS that managed and deliverd traffic on a very large scale for the largest broadcast company in Malaysia: Media Prima. We also built a lightweight, RESTful chat server on top of EuropaPHP that scaled past a concurrency of 4000 requests, across two web servers sharing two MongoDB replica sets. Viocorp gave me the opportunity to push my boundaries and learn new skills because of the great team I had the pleasure of working with.</p>

                            <p>I was originally brought in to work on Interspire Website Publisher as a Senior Software Engineer and eventually take over as its lead engineer. Shortly after, product development was discontinued and I was moved to lead engineer of Interspire Email Marketer. Eventually they decided to focus their efforts on their, now flagship product, Big Commerce, and discontinued product development on Email Marketer. I continued working on Big Commerce for the final months of my employment. I then decided to move on because my role did not allow for further professional development. I worked with a fantastic team that I continue to learn from to this day.</p>

                            <p>The goal of Solution 4 was to address the clunky, slow and malnourished pool of financial solutions with a fresh take on the average Financial CRM. Since I was the most senior JavaScript developer, I naturally took responsibility in mentoring others to ensure that everything was done to satisfaction. Not only did I learn more about myself, this role taught me to trust my abilities. Solution 4 also taught me the importance of a solid, cohesive team.</p>

                    <p>Currently I am freelancing with a company called Tequila as a Senior Frontend Developer. We are using <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> to drive our UIs. <a href="http://github.com/treshugart/Jive">Jive</a> is also being used for cross-browser <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history">history.pushState()</a></code> functionality and controller routing.</p>

                    <p>I worked as head of PHP on a proprietary CMS to make very tight deadlines on six sites for the largest broadcast company in Malaysia: Media Prima. The CMS was built on top of PHP, Red Hat, Apache and SQL Server on Windows Server 2008. Deployment was automated using Ruby's own Capistrano.</p>
                    <p>We also built a simple HTTP JSON-based chat server using PHP, Ruby, MongoDB and Nginx that scaled past a concurrency of 4000 requests on two boxes that shared a replica set of two MongoDB instances. Deployment was also automated via Capistrano.</p>
                    <p>Both the CMS and Chat server were built on top of <a href="http://europaphp.org">EuropaPHP</a>.</p>
                    <p>The work I did at Viocorp was some of the coolest work I've done to date. On top of that the team there was my second family. Great people.</p>

                    <p>I was a Lead Developer and Senior Software Engineer when Big Commerce was Interspire. I was originally brought in to work on Interspire Website Publisher as a Senior Software Engineer and moved to be Lead Engineer of Interspire Email Marketer after a few months. I then moved on to Interspire Shopping Cart which is now hosted as Big Commerce.</p>
                    <p>I can't say enough good things about the team at Big Commerce. They are a bunch of very bright individuals who taught me a lot and made work not seem so much like work.</p>

                    <p>At Solution 4, I had a great deal of influence on the user experience of the CRM that we were building. The jQuery and X/HTML driven front-end was built on top of PHP 5.2+ backed by MySQL, running under Apache and held together by Fedora.</p>
                    <p>The best part about working for Solution 4 was how well the developers worked together. I met some really great people there. It was an experience I will never forget.</p>

                    <p>Yes, another PHP framework. The only difference is that it's faster, more efficient, more focused and more standards compliant than any other PHP framework.</p>

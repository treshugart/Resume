                            <p>I was brought into UltraServe to set up a framework for a new Research and Development project that allows people to manage their entire cloud infrastucture both easily and effectively. My role here requires me to be adroit in many different technologies so that the well written, polyglot codebase will function well now and into the future.</p>
                            <p>The goal was to modularise each aspect, use the right tool for the right job and maintain over 60% code coverage all while keeping technical debt to a minimum. Currently, we have almost 80% code coverage, use PHP, Ruby, JavaScript (both Node and browser), HTML5, PosgreSQL and MongoDB. Each part of the application is functionally modularised into separate components and there is almost zero technical debt.</p>

In that time, I had the opportunity to work on many small projects as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia's Banknotes website which included three JavaScript games:</p>

                            <p>I worked as head of PHP on a proprietary CMS to make very tight deadlines on six sites for the largest broadcast company in Malaysia: Media Prima. On top developing the CMS, we also built a simple RESTful chat server on top of EuropaPHP that scaled past a concurrency of 4000 requests on two boxes that shared a replica set of two MongoDB instances. Viocorp gave me the opportunity to push my boundaries both personally and professionally which is attributed to both the intesity of the job as well as the integrity of the people I had the pleasure of working with.</p>

I then moved on to Interspire Shopping Cart which is now hosted as Big Commerce. I can't say enough good things about the team at Big Commerce. They are a bunch of very bright individuals who taught me a lot about myself and my work.</p>

                            <p>The goal of Solution 4 was to address the clunky, slow and malnourished pool of solutions with a fresh take on a Financial CRM. Although I did a healthy amount of PHP development, I was the most senior JavaScript developer so I naturally took responsibility in mentoring the other employees where necessary to ensure that everything front-end was done properly. Not only did I learn a lot about myself and my abilities, Solution 4 taught me the importance of a solid, cohesive team.</p>

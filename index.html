                    <p>I worked as head of PHP on a proprietary CMS to make very tight deadlines on six sites for the largest broadcast company in Malaysia: Media Prima. The CMS was built on top of PHP, Red Hat, Apache and SQL Server on Windows Server 2008. Deployment was automated using Ruby's own Capistrano.</p>
                    <p>We also built a simple HTTP JSON-based chat server using PHP, Ruby, MongoDB and Nginx that scaled past a concurrency of 4000 requests on two boxes that shared two MongoDB replica sets. Deployment was also automated via Capistrano.</p>
                    <p>Both the CMS and Chat server were built on top of <a href="http://europaphp.org">EuropaPHP</a>.</p>
